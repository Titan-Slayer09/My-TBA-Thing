# My-TBA-Thing
Im making a Text-Based adventure, if anyone wants to help me that would be cool.

Currently my code is long, repetitive and boring, I currently have my story, and how I want the story to be. but how I want the story to be is not where it is at. Help me if you want, I could use it. For more info, there is comments at the beggining of TBA and TBAai ALSO let me know if my story is boring, or if i should change it up a bit, or if anyone just sees a better option.
